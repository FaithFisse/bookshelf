# Bookshelf 
## Bookshelf is my personal project for tracking books that have been read, as well as possibly rating and reviewing them. 
- Reading is one of my most loved hobbies and I wanted to try to make my own app/webiste that will track a reader's books throughout the year. My hope is eventually this will be fully functional and allow the reader to rate, write reviews, and at the end of every year have their own persoanlized year in books including the amount of pages and books they have read.
